### New concepts and maximum decentralization

[Decentralized finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_finance) (DeFi) refers to a set of means to **exchange, buy and sell crypto assets without a third party such as brokers, banks or third-party**. The DeFi ecosystem has experienced significant growth from 2020, in particular with protocols like Uniswap, Aave or Curve, and several billions of dollars invested.

Unfortunately, several DeFi applications have experienced **security issues**, directly impacting users. In addition, their features may be **dependent on centralized third-party services**, increasing the risk of problems (Single Point of Failure). This is why the **level of decentralization** of DeFi protocols is one of the most important points to consider.

[Dusa](https://dusa.io/) wants to offer a DeFi experience with a **maximum decentralization** and **new features**, in order to differentiate itself in this very competitive field. For this, the Dusa Labs team has implemented various innovative technical solutions, which are currently in the beta test.

### How it works ?

Dusa protocol is based on the [Massa](https://massa.net/) Blockchain, which aims to be as decentralized as possible. For this, Massa implements a technology allowing nodes to **create blocks in parallel**, and therefore to process **more than 1000 transactions per second**. Based on **proof of stake**, the consensus protocol is built to be open to as many people as possible to encourage decentralization.

Massa offers a key feature; [autonomous smart contracts](https://massa.net/autonomous-sc/). These are smart contracts that have auto-waking functionality, allowing arbitrary operations to be performed autonomously. Dusa uses this feature to introduce the concept of [autonomous liquidity](https://mirror.xyz/0xdA2d2Cd69DAa9bC226B1061F18b56983c9f3be6A/be-KkSwDPRRlT6foX0emhfoD2SP2Qqts9EvzMlMekGw).

Generally, DeFi protocols use the concept of **concentrated liquidity**; liquidity providers (LP) distribute their capital over a **defined price range**, creating many positions within a single pool. To optimize their returns, LPs must actively manage their positions according to market variations, which requires complex and costly work for individuals. In reality, most of these activities are done by professionals with bots.
The concept of autonomous liquidity introduced by Dusa aims to solve this problem, by offering users a way to **automatically manage their positions**. Autonomous smart contracts are able to adapt the distribution of liquidity within the pools in **real time**, depending on a certain number of parameters such as the exchange rate of the assets. Dusa offers **models** to allow users to choose their **strategy** and optimize their **risks and returns**.

### Many Challenge

The DeFi ecosystem is constantly evolving, as Dusa project proves. To make the difference among the many competing projects, several challenges must be taken up.

- **UX**: The user experience is one of the crucial points to develop, in order to offer a simple, intuitive and functional experience.

- **Security**: The past few months have not been easy for the crypto ecosystem as a whole. Between hacks, vulnerabilities and bankruptcies, users need to be reassured about the security of the project. For this, a security policy, in particular with measures and audits, is essential. 

- **Decentralization**: Dusa wants to be as decentralized as possible; so it is necessary to consider all the axes; front-end, data storage, consensus, governance, etc.

- **Community**: A decentralized project is nothing without a solid and strong community.

Dusa offers a project focused on **decentralization** while providing **innovative features**, previously reserved for professionals. Today in the development phase, we are eager to discover the final version of the application to test these new concepts.
